Recently, automated writing evaluation (AWE) and automated writing feedback tools have attracted attention in the research field of natural language processing (NLP). To make automated writing feedback tools more available to students from low-income families, we propose a model which is based on Longformer, a pre-trained model, to initialize an automated writing feedback tool. The dataset we use contains 15594 essays written by students in grades 6-12 in the United States. We compare our model with Long short-term memory (LSTM) models, BigBird, and our baseline model, BERT. The experimental results indicate that our model which consumes a reasonable training time generates well-performance feedback to the essays in the test set with a fast running time. The results also show that our Longformer based model improved the F1 score from 42.00\% (baseline model) to 67.00\%. Furthermore, we plan to develop a open source AWE software based on our model in the future.
